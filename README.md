# personal_website
Repository for my personal website project

Any edits can be made in my github_projects/personal_website remote repository. Push edits using git add ., git commit -m "", then git push heroku main.
If I push using the normal git command it goes here, but if I use the heroku command it deploys. So to change both, I'd need to run both commands.

Information on how I connected my custom domain to the heroku app here: https://medium.com/@david.gagne/set-up-a-custom-domain-for-your-heroku-application-using-google-domains-guaranteed-a2b2ff934f97
